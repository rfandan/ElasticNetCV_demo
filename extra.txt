REGRESSION_MODEL - Complete Setup and Workflow

This text contains all steps for setting up, managing, and developing the Regression Model project using ElasticNetCV, including environment setup, dependencies, and packaging.

Project Structure (Recommended):

ElasticNetCV_demo/
├── src/
│   └── my_package/
│       └── __init__.py
├── .venv/                       (Virtual environment folder)
├── requirements.txt             (Runtime dependencies like numpy, pandas)
├── requirements-dev.txt         (Development dependencies like Ruff, pytest, mypy)
├── setup.py                     (Project packaging & install script)
├── pyproject.toml               (Ruff configuration)
└── README.txt                   (This reference file)

- Source code should go inside src/my_package/
- .venv contains the virtual environment
- requirements.txt contains runtime dependencies
- requirements-dev.txt contains development dependencies (Ruff, pytest, mypy)
- setup.py handles installation of dependencies and packaging
- pyproject.toml configures Ruff linter

Step 1: Create and Activate Virtual Environment

1. Create the virtual environment (only once):
   python -m venv .venv

2. Activate the virtual environment:
   source .venv/bin/activate      (macOS/Linux)
   .venv\Scripts\activate         (Windows)

3. Upgrade pip and packaging tools:
   python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel

Note: Using a virtual environment isolates project dependencies from the system Python.

Step 2: Install Project Dependencies

Install both runtime and development dependencies:
   python -m pip install .[dev]

Explanation:
- install_requires from requirements.txt provides runtime dependencies.
- extras_require["dev"] from requirements-dev.txt provides development dependencies like Ruff, pytest, mypy.
- Using "python -m pip" ensures the correct Python interpreter is used.

Step 3: Project Packaging (setup.py)

The setup.py file:

from setuptools import setup, find_packages

def read_requirements(filename: str):
    with open(filename, encoding="utf-8") as f:
        return [line.strip() for line in f if line.strip() and not line.startswith("#")]

setup(
    name="REGRESSION_MODEL",
    version="0.0.1",
    description="Regression model using ElasticNetCV",
    author="RAJVEER FANDAN",
    author_email="dummy@example.com",
    packages=find_packages(),
    install_requires=read_requirements("requirements.txt"),
    extras_require={"dev": read_requirements("requirements-dev.txt")},
    python_requires=">=3.8",
)

Install the package locally:
   python -m pip install .[dev]

This installs both runtime and development dependencies, making the project ready for coding and development.

Step 4: Ruff Configuration (pyproject.toml)

[tool.ruff]
line-length = 88
target-version = "py310"
select = ["E", "F", "I", "B"]
ignore = ["E501"]

[build-system]
requires = ["setuptools>=61.0"]
build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"

Explanation:
- Configures Ruff rules such as maximum line length, selected checks, ignored warnings, and Python version.

Step 5: Quick Commands Reference

- Activate virtual environment:
   source .venv/bin/activate

- Install dependencies:
   python -m pip install .[dev]

- Reinstall after updating requirements:
   python -m pip install --upgrade .[dev]

- Optional: Run Ruff linter from terminal:
   python -m ruff check . --fix

Step 6: Best Practices

- Always activate your virtual environment before running commands.
- Keep requirements.txt and requirements-dev.txt updated as dependencies change.
- Use python -m pip install .[dev] whenever installing or updating dependencies.
- Keep imports at the top of all Python files to comply with PEP8.
- Run ruff check . --fix regularly to maintain clean code.
